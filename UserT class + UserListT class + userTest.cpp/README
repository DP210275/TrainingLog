UserT header and implementation file were updated. These will both need updated.

In my UserTest.cpp There are two new functions that are needed. FloatCheck() (Line 91) and ProgressCheck() (Line 108).

FloatCheck can be put anywhere in the merged file along side ProgressCheck, as long as they are global. 

Specifically though, ProgressCheck() needs to be called on line ~1834 Where "Overall Performance" is. The line cout "/t Overall Performance" can be deleted as its taken care of in my code.

As always please test and let me know if any issues arise. Thank you for your help.
